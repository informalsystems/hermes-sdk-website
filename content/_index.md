# Introduction

Hermes SDK is a next-generation Interchain framework to support the complex landscape
of inter-connected blockchains.

It supports the use of
[Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/) to connect
[Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) blockchains, as well as other kinds of blockchains such as [Starknet](https://www.starknet.io/).
